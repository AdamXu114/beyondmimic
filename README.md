## Overview

BeyondMimic is a versatile humanoid control framework that provides highly-dynamic motion tracking with the state-of-the-art motion quality on real-world deployment and steerable test-time control with guided diffusion-based controllers. This repo covers the simulator-related framework in BeyondMimic, which is used to train the motion tracking policies, as well as data collection for the diffusion training. 


## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html). We recommend using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.
<!-- 
- **This repo uses git-lfs to store usd. You need to install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)**.  -->

- Clone this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

```bash
# Option 1: HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/qiayuanl/whole_body_tracking.git
```

- Pull the robot description files

```bash
# Enter the repository
cd whole_body_tracking
# Rename all occurrences of whole_body_tracking (in files/directories) to your_fancy_extension_name
curl -L -o unitree_description.tar.gz https://storage.googleapis.com/qiayuanl_robot_descriptions/unitree_description.tar.gz && \
tar -xzf unitree_description.tar.gz -C source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/assets/ && \
rm unitree_description.tar.gz
```

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/whole_body_tracking
```

### Set up IDE (Optional)

To setup the IDE, please follow these instructions:

- Run VSCode Tasks, by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, selecting `Tasks: Run Task` and running the `setup_python_env` in the drop down menu. When running this task, you will be prompted to add the absolute path to your Isaac Sim installation.

If everything executes correctly, it should create a file .python.env in the `.vscode` directory. The file contains the python paths to all the extensions provided by Isaac Sim and Omniverse. This helps in indexing all the python modules for intelligent suggestions while writing code.

### Setup as Omniverse Extension (Optional)

We provide an example UI extension that will load upon enabling your extension defined in `source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/ui_extension_example.py`.

To enable your extension, follow these steps:

1. **Add the search path of your repository** to the extension manager:
    - Navigate to the extension manager using `Window` -> `Extensions`.
    - Click on the **Hamburger Icon** (☰), then go to `Settings`.
    - In the `Extension Search Paths`, enter the absolute path to `IsaacLabExtensionTemplate/source`
    - If not already present, in the `Extension Search Paths`, enter the path that leads to Isaac Lab's extension directory directory (`IsaacLab/source`)
    - Click on the **Hamburger Icon** (☰), then click `Refresh`.

2. **Search and enable your extension**:
    - Find your extension under the `Third Party` category.
    - Toggle it to enable your extension.


## Motion Tracking

### Motion Preprocessing & Registry Setup
Note: The reference motion should be retargeted and use generalized coordinates only. 

- Gather the reference motion datasets (please follow the original licenses)
    
    - Unitree-retargeted LAFAN1 Dataset is available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lvhaidong/LAFAN1_Retargeting_Dataset)
    - Sidekicks are from [KungfuBot](https://kungfu-bot.github.io/)
    - Christiano Ronaldo celebration is from [ASAP](https://github.com/LeCAR-Lab/ASAP). 
    - Balance motions are from [HuB](https://hub-robot.github.io/)


- Log in to your WandB account; access Registry under Core on the left. Create a new registry with name "Motions" and artifact type "All Types". 

- Update the WandB api to at least 0.19
```bash
python -m pip install wandb==0.19
```

- Convert retargeted motions to include the maximum coordinates information (body pose, body velocity, and body acceleration) via forward kinematics,

```bash
python scripts/csv_to_npz.py --input_file {motion_name}.csv --input_fps 30 --output_name {motion_name}
```

This will automatically upload the processed motion file to WandB registry with output name {motion_name}. 


- Test if WandB registry works properly by replaying the motion in Isaac Sim:

```bash
python scripts/replay_npz.py --registry_name={your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name}
```

- Debugging
    - Make sure to export WANDB_ENTITY to your organization name, not your personal username. 
    - If /tmp folder is not accessible, modify csv_to_npz.py L319 & L326 to a temporary folder of your choice. 

### Policy Training
- Train policy by the following command:
```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
--registry_name {your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name} \
--headless --logger wandb --log_project_name {project_name} --run_name {run_name}
```

### Policy Evaluation


- Play the trained policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 --num_envs=2 --wandb_path={wandb-run-path}
```

The WandB run path can be located in the run overview. It follows the format {your_organization}/{project_name}/ along with a unique 8-character identifier. Note that run_name is different from run_path. 

## Code Structure

Below is an overview of the code structure for this repository:

- **`source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/tasks/tracking/mdp`**  
    This directory contains the atomic functions to define the MDP for BeyondMimic. Below is a breakdown of the functions:

    - **`commands.py`**  
        Command library to compute relevant variables from the reference motion, current robot state, and error computations. This includes pose and velocity error calculation, initial state randomization, and adaptive sampling. 

    - **`rewards.py`**  
        Implements the DeepMimic reward functions and smoothing terms.

    - **`events.py`**  
        Implements domain randomization terms.

    - **`observations.py`**  
        Implements observation terms for motion tracking and data collection.

    - **`terminations.py`**

    Contains robot-specific settings, including armature parameters, joint stiffness/damping (PD gains) calculation, and action scale calculation. 

- **`scripts`**  
    Includes utility scripts for preprocessing motion data, training policies, and evaluating trained policies.

This structure is designed to ensure modularity and ease of navigation for developers expanding the project.

## Docker setup

### Building Isaac Lab Base Image

Currently, we don't have the Docker for Isaac Lab publicly available. Hence, you'd need to build the docker image
for Isaac Lab locally by following the steps [here](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/deployment/index.html).

Once you have built the base Isaac Lab image, you can check it exists by doing:

```bash
docker images

# Output should look something like:
#
# REPOSITORY                       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
# isaac-lab-base                   latest    28be62af627e   32 minutes ago   18.9GB
```

### Building Isaac Lab Template Image

Following above, you can build the docker container for this project. It is called `isaac-lab-template`. However,
you can modify this name inside the [`docker/docker-compose.yaml`](docker/docker-compose.yaml).

```bash
cd docker
docker compose --env-file .env.base --file docker-compose.yaml build isaac-lab-template
```

You can verify the image is built successfully using the same command as earlier:

```bash
docker images

# Output should look something like:
#
# REPOSITORY                       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
# isaac-lab-template               latest    00b00b647e1b   2 minutes ago       18.9GB
# isaac-lab-base                   latest    892938acb55c   About an hour ago   18.9GB
```

### Running the container

After building, the usual next step is to start the containers associated with your services. You can do this with:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.base --file docker-compose.yaml up
```

This will start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yaml` file, including isaac-lab-template.

If you want to run it in detached mode (in the background), use:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.base --file docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

### Interacting with a running container

If you want to run commands inside the running container, you can use the `exec` command:

```bash
docker exec --interactive --tty -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} isaac-lab-template /bin/bash
```

### Shutting down the container

When you are done or want to stop the running containers, you can bring down the services:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.base --file docker-compose.yaml down
```

This stops and removes the containers, but keeps the images.

## Code formatting

We have a pre-commit template to automatically format your code.
To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then you can run pre-commit with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pylance Missing Indexing of Extensions

In some VsCode versions, the indexing of part of the extensions is missing. In this case, add the path to your extension in `.vscode/settings.json` under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`.

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "<path-to-ext-repo>/source/whole_body_tracking"
    ]
}
```

### Pylance Crash

If you encounter a crash in `pylance`, it is probable that too many files are indexed and you run out of memory.
A possible solution is to exclude some of omniverse packages that are not used in your project.
To do so, modify `.vscode/settings.json` and comment out packages under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`
Some examples of packages that can likely be excluded are:

```json
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.anim.*"         // Animation packages
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.kit.*"          // Kit UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.graph.*"        // Graph UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.services.*"     // Services tools
...
```
